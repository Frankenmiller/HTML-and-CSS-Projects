<p><h4><b>Very naughty breed of hybrid dog but also very possessive of their
handlers, they will attack almost anything that threatens them, even if
it is much larger than them.</b></h4></p>
<img src = "./Images/Cheweenie_ReadytoPounce.jpg">
<p><b>They are very sweet companions and love to be held. If you treat them
    as your child they will respond very well, loving you for your entire life.
Some dog experts recommend that you do not sleep with your dogs, but I don't know
how one could resist, or really what was the point of having a dog if it wasn't going
to accompany you while resting.</b>
